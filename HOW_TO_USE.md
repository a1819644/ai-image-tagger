# How to Use Asset Master 3.0

This guide will walk you through the features of the Asset Master application.

## 1. Initial Setup: API Key

On your first launch, the application will ask for an API key.

1.  Click the **Select API Key** button.
2.  This application uses the Google Gemini AI model for its intelligent features. You must provide an API key from a **billing-enabled** Google AI project for the application to work.

## 2. Feature: Bulk SEO Tagger

This is the core feature for processing multiple images at once to generate SEO-friendly metadata and embed location data.

### Workflow:

1.  **Select Mode:** Ensure the **Bulk SEO Tagger** tab is active.
2.  **Configure Settings (Optional):**
    *   **Branding:** Enter your company name. This will be used in the generated metadata.
    *   **GEO Hub:** Select a preset location from the dropdown, or use the "Fetch Live GPS" button to use your browser's current location. You can also toggle **Auto-GPS** to have the app randomly assign a location from the presets to each uploaded image.
    *   **Engines:** Toggle the **AI Meta** switch off if you do not want the AI to generate new filenames, descriptions, and tags.
3.  **Upload Images:** Drag and drop your project photos into the uploader box. The app supports multiple images at once, including `.heic` files, which will be converted automatically.
4.  **Processing:** The app will process images one by one. You will see the status change on each image card from `Waiting...` to `AI Analyzing...`, `AI Enhancing...`, and finally `SEO Ready`.
5.  **Review and Edit:** Once an image is `SEO Ready`, you can review the data generated by the AI. All fields (SEO Filename, Alt Description, etc.) are editable. Simply click on them and type to make changes.
6.  **Download:**
    *   Click the **Download SEO Master** button on any individual card to download that single processed image.
    *   Once you have processed multiple images, a **Download All Assets (ZIP)** button will appear at the top. Click this to download a master archive containing all the ready images.

## 3. Feature: Tech Synthesis

This feature allows you to realistically place a technician into a scene with an appliance.

### Workflow:

1.  **Select Mode:** Click the **Tech Synthesis** tab.
2.  **Upload Base Scene:** In the first box, click to select your "Base Scene" image (e.g., the photo of the appliance in a kitchen).
3.  **Draw Placement Box:** The base image will appear on an interactive canvas. **Click and drag your mouse on the image** to draw a rectangle. This box tells the AI exactly where to place the technician and at what size.
4.  **Upload Technician:** In the second box, select the image of the "Isolated Technician".
5.  **Generate Composite:** Once you have a base image, a technician image, and you have drawn a placement box, the **Create Composite & Analyze** button will become active. Click it.
6.  **Processing:** The AI will perform several steps:
    *   It will upscale the technician image to ensure it's high quality.
    *   It will place the technician inside the box you drew, intelligently blending the lighting and perspective.
    *   It will then treat the newly generated composite as a new image and generate SEO metadata for it.
7.  **Review and Download:** The final image will appear in a card below, just like in the Bulk Tagger. You can edit its metadata and click **Download SEO Master** to save it.
